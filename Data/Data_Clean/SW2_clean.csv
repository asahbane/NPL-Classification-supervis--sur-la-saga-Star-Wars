CAPTAIN TYPHO;We made it. I guess I was wrong,there was no danger at all.
PADME ;Cordé
CORDÉ; I'm sorry, m'lady I'm not sure I 
AMIDALA;No! No! No!
AMIDALA;I should not have come back.
CAPTAIN TYPHO;M'Lady, you are still in danger.
CAPTAIN TYPHO;This vote is very important. You didyour duty and Cordé did hers. Nowcome. M'Lady,please!
MAS AMEDDA;Order! We shall have order! The motionfor the Republic to commission an armytakes precedent, and that is what wewill vote on at this time.
PALPATINE;My esteemed colleagues, excuseme I have just received sometragic and disturbing news. SenatorAmidala of the Naboo system Hasbeen assassinated!
PALPATINE;This grievous blow is especiallypersonal to me. Before I becameChancellor, I served Amidala whenshe was Queen. She was a greatleader who fought for justice, notonly in this honourable assembly,but also on her home planet. Shewas so loved she could have beenelected queen for life. Shebelieved in public service, andshe fervently believed indemocracy. Her death is a greatloss to us all. We will all mournher as a relentless champion offreedom and as a dear friend.
SENATOR ASK AAK;How many more Senators will diebefore this civil strife ends! Wemust confront these rebels now,and they need an army to do it.
AMBASSADOR DARSANA;Why weren't the Jedi able to stopthis assassination? We are nolonger safe, under their protection.
ORN FREE TAA;The Republic needs more securitynow! Before it comes to war.
PALPATINE;Must I remind the Senator fromMalastare that negotiations arecontinuing with the separatists.Peace is our objective here notwar.
AMIDALA;My noble colleagues, I concur withthe Supreme Chancellor. At allcosts, we do not want war!
PALPATINE;It is with great surprise andjoy the chair recognises theSenator from Naboo, Padmé Amidala.
PADME;Less than an hour ago, anassassination attempt was madeagainst my life. One of mybodyguards and six  others wereruthlessly and senselesslymurdered. I was the target but,more importantly, I believe thissecurity measure before you, wasthe target. I have led theopposition to build an army butthere is someone in this body whowill stop at nothing to assure it'spassage
PADME;"I warn you, if you vote to createthis army, war will follow. Ihave experienced the misery of war first-hand; I do not wish to do itagain."
PADME;Wake up, Senators you must wakeup! If you offer the separatistsviolence, they can only show usviolence in return! Many willlose their lives. All will losetheir freedom. This decisioncould very well destroy the veryfoundation of our great Republic.I pray you do not let fear pushyou into a disastrous decision.Vote down this security measure,which is nothing less than adeclaration of war! Does anyonehere want that? I cannot believethey do.
ORN FREE TAA;My motion to defer the vote mustbe dealt with first. That is therule of law.
PALPATINE;Due to the lateness of the hourand the seriousness of thismotion, we will take up thesematters tomorrow. Until then, theSenate stands adjourned.
PALPATINE;I don't know how much longer I canhold off the vote, my friends.More and more star systems arejoining the separatists.
MACE WINDU;If they do break away -
PALPATINE;No! I will not let that happen!
MACE WINDU;But if they do, you must realisethere aren't enough Jedi toprotect the Republic. We arekeepers of the peace, not soldiers.
PALPATINE;Master Yoda, do you think it willreally come to war?
YODA;Worse than war, I fear Muchworse. 
PALPATINE;What?
MACE WINDU;What do you sense, Master?
YODA;Impossible to see  The Dark Sideclouds everything. But this I amsure of Do their duty the Jedi will.
DAR WAC;The loyalist committee has arrived,my Lord. 
PALPATINE;Send them in.
YODA;With you the force is strongyoung Senator. To see you alivebrings warm feeling to my heart.
PADMÉ;Thank you, Master Yoda. Do youhave any idea who was behindthe attack?
MACE WINDU;Our intelligence points todisgruntled spice miners, onthe moons of Naboo.
PADMÉ;I don't wish to disagree but Ithink that Count Dooku was behindit.
MACE WINDU;You know, M'Lady, Count Dookuwas once a Jedi. He wouldn'tassassinate anyone, it is not inhis character.
KI-ADI-MUNDI;He is a political idealist, nota murderer.
YODA;In dark times nothing is what itappears to be, but the fact remainsSenator, in grave danger you are.
PALPATINE;Count Dooku has always avoidedany kind of conflict. It appearshe has no desire to start a war.Why would he kill you? To what end?
PADMÉ ;I don't know, but everything in mybeing tells me he was behind it 
PALPATINE;Master Jedi, may I suggest thatthe Senator be placed under theprotection of your graces.
BAIL ORGANA;Do you think that is a wise useof manpower during these stressfultimes?
PADMÉ;Chancellor, if I may comment, Ido not believe the
PALPATINE;No, but I do, Senator.
PADMÉ;Chancellor, please! I don't wantany more guards!
PALPATINE;I realise all too well thatadditional security might bedisruptive for you, but perhapssomeone you are familiar with anold friend like Master Kenobi
MACE WINDU;That's possible. He has justreturned from a Border dispute onAnsion.
PALPATINE;You must remember him, M'Ladyhe watched over you during theblockade conflict.
PADMÉ;This is not necessary, Chancellor.
PALPATINE;Do it for me, M'Lady, please. Iwill rest easier. We had a bigscare today. The thought oflosing you is unbearable.
MACE WINDU;I will have Obi-Wan report to youimmediately, M'Lady.
YODA;Too little about yourself youworry, Senator, and too much aboutpolitics. Be mindful of yourdanger, Padmé. Accept our help.
PALPATINE;I will not like this Republiv, thathas stood for over a thousandyears, be split in two
JAR JAR;Obi! Obi! Obi! Mesa sooo smilento see'en yousa. Wahoooooo!
OBI-WAN;It's Good to see you, too, Jar Jar.
JAR JAR;Oops! Wheresa mesa manners?Excuse me, Master Obi-Wan. Icompletely forgot myself fora moment there. I have had to learnDiplodiaclect speak it like anative now. Don't really see thepoint, actually, but members ofthe Senate seem to prefer it
JAR JAR;and this, I take it, is yourapprentice Nooooooooo! Annie?Noooooooo! Little Bitty Annie?Nooooooo! Yousa so biggen!Yiyiyiyyi! Annie!! Mesa nobelieven.
ANAKIN;Hi, Jar Jar.
JAR JAR;Annie! Annie! Yiyiyiyiyiyiiii!
JAR JAR;Lookie lookie Oops! Oh,dear, I'm afraid I've forgottenmyself again.
OBI-WAN;It's a great pleasure to see you again,M'Lady.
PADMÉ;It has been far too long MasterKenobi. I'm so glad our pathshave crossed again but I mustwarn you that I think yourpresence here is unnecessary.
OBI-WAN;I'm sure the Jedi Council havetheir reasons.
PADMÉ;Annie??My goodness you've grown.
ANAKIN;So have you grown morebeautiful, I mean and muchshorter for a Senator, I mean.
PADMÉ;Oh Annie, you'll always be thatlittle boy I knew on Tatooine.
OBI-WAN;Our presence will be invisible,M'Lady.
CAPTAIN TYPHO;I am very grateful you are here,Master Kenobi. The situation ismore dangerous than the Senatorwill admit.
PADMÉ;I don't need more security, I needanswers. I want to know who istrying to kill me.
OBI-WAN;We're here to protect youSenator, not to start aninvestigation.
ANAKIN;We will find out who is trying tokill you Padmé, I promise you.
OBI-WAN;We are not going to exceed ourmandate, my young Padawan learner.
ANAKIN;I meant in the interest ofprotecting her, Master, of course.
OBI-WAN;We are not going through thisexercise again, Anakin. You willpay attention to my lead.
ANAKIN;Why?
OBI-WAN;What??!!
ANAKIN;Why else do you think we wereassigned to her, if not to findthe killer? Protection is a jobfor local security not Jedi.It's overkill, Master.Investigation is implied in ourmandate.
OBI-WAN;We will do as the Council hasinstructed, and you will learnyour place, young one.
PADMÉ;Perhaps with merely your presence,the mysteries surrounding thisthreat will be revealed.  Now ifyou will excuse me I will retire.
CAPTAIN TYPHO;Well, I know I feel a lot betterhaving you here.I'll have an officer on everyfloor and I'll be at the commandcentre downstairs.
JAR JAR ;Mesa busten wit happiness seeinYousa again, Annie. Deesa badtimes, bombad times.
ANAKIN;She didn't even recognise me, JarJar. I thought about her everyday since we parted and she'sforgotten me completely.
JAR JAR;Shesa happy. Happier den mesasee-en her in longo time.
OBI-WAN;Anakin, you're focusing on theNegative again. Be mindful of yourthoughts. She was glad to see us.Now lets check the security here.
ANAKIN;Yes, my master.
MACE WINDU;Why couldn't we see this attack onthe Senator?
YODA;Masking the future, is thisdisturbance in the Force.
MACE WINDU;The propecy is coming true, theDark Side is growing.
YODA;And only those who have turned tothe Dark Side can sense thepossibilities of the future. Onlygoing through the Dark Side can wesee.
MACE WINDU;It's been ten years, and the Sithstill have no shown themselves.Do you think they are behind this?
YODA;Out there, they are. Acertainty that is.
MACE WINDU;Do you think Obi-Wan's apprenticewill be able to bring balance tothe Force?
YODA;Only if he chooses to follow hisdestiny.
OBI-WAN;Captain Typho has more than enoughmen downstairs. No assassin willtry that way. Any activity uphere?
ANAKIN;Quiet as a tomb. I don't likejust waiting here for something tohappen to her.
OBI-WAN;What's going on?
ANAKIN;She covered that camera. I don'tthink she liked me watching her.
OBI-WAN;What is she thinking?
ANAKIN;She programmed Artoo to warn us ifthere's an intruder.
OBI-WAN;It's not an intruder I'm worriedabout. There are many other waysto kill a Senator.
ANAKIN;I know, but we also want to catchthis assassin. Don't we, Master?
OBI-WAN;You're using her as bait??
ANAKIN;It was her idea No harm willcome to her. I can senseeverything going on in that room.Trust me.
OBI-WAN;It's too risky and your sensesaren't that attuned, youngapprentice.
ANAKIN;And yours are?
OBI-WAN;Possibly.
OBI-WAN ;You look tired.
ANAKIN;I don't sleep well, anymore.
OBI-WAN ;Because of your mother?
ANAKIN;I don't know why I keep dreamingAbout her now. I haven't seen hersince I was little.
OBI-WAN;Dreams pass in time.
ANAKIN;I'd rather dream of Padmé. JustBeing around her again isintoxicating.
OBI-WAN;Mind your thoughts, Anakin, theybetray you. You've made acommitment to the Jedi order acommitment not easily brokenand don't forget she's apolitician. They're not to betrusted.
ANAKIN ;She's not like the others in theSenate, Master.
OBI-WAN;It's been my experience thatSenators are only focused onpleasing those who fund theircampaigns and they are morethan willing to forget theniceties of democracy to get thosefunds.
ANAKIN;Not another lecture, Master. Noton the economics of politics.It's too early in the morning andbesides, you're generalising. TheChancellor doesn't appear tobe corrupt.
OBI-WAN;Palpatine's a politician, I'veobserved that he is very clever atfollowing the passions andprejudices of the Senators.
ANAKIN;I think he is a good man. Myinstincts are very positiveabout
OBI-WAN;I sense it, too.
ANAKIN;Stay here!
OBI-WAN;I have a bad feeling about this.
ANAKIN;That was wacky! I almost lost youin the traffic.
OBI-WAN;What took you so long?
ANAKIN;Oh, you know, Master, I couldn'tfind a speeder I really liked,with an open cockpit and withthe right speed capabilitiesand then you know I had to get areally gonzo color
OBI-WAN;If you'd spend as much timeworking on your saber skills asyou do on your wit, young Padawan,you would rival Master Yoda as aswordsman.
ANAKIN;I thought I already did.
OBI-WAN;Only in your mind, my very youngapprentice. Careful!! Hey, easy!!
ANAKIN;Sorry, I forgot you don't likeflying, Master.
OBI-WAN;I don't mind flying butwhat you're doing is suicide!
ANAKIN;Master, you know I've been flyingsince before I could walk. I'm verygood at this.
OBI-WAN;Just slow down!
OBI-WAN;Wait! Don't go in there!
OBI-WAN;You know I don't like it when youdo that!
ANAKIN;Sorry, Master. Don't worry, thisguy's gonna kill himself anyminute now!
OBI-WAN;What are you doing? He's gonnablast me!
ANAKIN;Right - this isn't working.
OBI-WAN;That was too close!
ANAKIN;Clear that!
OBI-WAN;What??
ANAKIN;Clear the flag! We're losingpower! Hurry!
OBI-WAN;Whooooaaa! Don't do that! Idon't  like it when you do that!
ANAKIN;So sorry, Master.
OBI-WAN;It's dangerous near those powercouplings! Slow down! Don't gothrough there!
OBI-WAN;Yiiii, what are you doing?
ANAKIN;Sorry, Master!
OBI-WAN;Oh, that was good
ANAKIN;That was crazy!!!
ANAKIN;Ahh, damn.
OBI-WAN;Stop!!
ANAKIN;No, we can make it.
OBI-WAN;I'm crazy I'm crazy I'mcrazy.
ANAKIN;But it worked we made it.
OBI-WAN;It didn't work we've stalled!And you almost got us killed!
ANAKIN;I think we're still alive.
OBI-WAN;It was stupid!
ANAKIN;I could have made it
OBI-WAN;But you didn't!!! And now we'velost him.
ANAKIN;No we didn’t
OBI-WAN;Where are you going?! He wentdown there, the other way.
ANAKIN;This is a shortcut I think.
OBI-WAN;What do you mean, ‘You think?’What kind of shortcut?! He wentcompletely the other way! You’velost him!
ANAKIN;Master, if we keep this chasegoing, that creep’s gonna end updeep fried. Personally, I’d verymuch like to find out who in thehell he is and who he’s workingfor
OBI-WAN;Oh, so that’s why we’re going inthe wrong direction.
OBI-WAN;Well, you lost him.
ANAKIN;I’m deeply sorry, Master.
ANAKIN;Excuse me for a moment.
OBI-WAN;Anakin!
ANAKIN;She went into that club, Master.
OBI-WAN;Patience.
OBI-WAN; 	Here. Next time try not to lose it.
ANAKIN;Sorry, Master.
OBI-WAN;A Jedi's saber is his mostprecious possession.
ANAKIN;Yes, Master.
OBI-WAN;He must keep it with him at alltimes.
ANAKIN;I know, Master.
OBI-WAN;This weapon is your life!
ANAKIN;I've heard this lesson before
OBI-WAN;But, you haven't learned anything,Anakin.
ANAKIN;I try, Master.
OBI-WAN;Why do I think you are going to bethe death of me?!
ANAKIN;Don't say that Master You'rethe closest thing I have to afather I love you. I don't wantto cause you pain.
OBI-WAN;Then why don't you listen to me?!
ANAKIN;I will. I'll do better, I promise.
OBI-WAN;Do you see him him?
ANAKIN;I think he's a she
OBI-WAN;Then be extra carefulCheck it out.
ANAKIN;Where are you going, Master?
OBI-WAN;To get a drink.
ELAN SLEAZEBAGGANO;Wanna buy some death sticks?
OBI-WAN;You don't want to sell me death-sticks.
ELAN;I don't want to sell you death-sticks.
OBI-WAN;You want to go home and rethink your life.
ELAN;I want to go home and rethink mylife.
ANAKIN;Easy Official business. Goback to your drinks.
OBI-WAN;Do you know who it was you weretrying to kill?
ZAM WESSEL;The Senator from Naboo.
OBI-WAN;Who hired you?
ZAM WESSEL;It was just a job.
ANAKIN;Tell us!
ZAM WESSEL;That Senator's gonna die soonanyway, and the next one won'tmake the same mistake I did
OBI-WAN;This wound's going to needtreatment.
ANAKIN;Who hired you? Tell us tell usnow!
ZAM;It was a Bounty Hunter called
OBI-WAN;Toxic Dart
PADMÉ;Representative Binks. I know I cancount on you.
JAR JAR;Yousa betchen mesa bottums.
PADMÉ;What?!
JAR JAR;Oh, pardone-ay, Senator. I mean,I am honoured to accept this heavyburden. I take on thisresponsibility with deep humilitytinged with an overwhelming pride.It is not every day that I amcalled upon to
PADMÉ;You're a good friend, Jar Jar. Idon't wish to hold you up. I'msure you have a great deal to do.
JAR JAR;Of course, M'lady.
PADMÉ;I do not like this idea of hiding.
ANAKIN;Don't worry. Now that the Councilhas ordered an investigation, itwon't take Master Obi-Wan long tofind that bounty hunter.
PADMÉ;"I haven't worked for a year todefeat the ""Military Creation Act""not to be here when its fate isdecided."
ANAKIN;Sometimes we have to let go of ourpride and do what is requested ofus.
PADMÉ;Pride?!? Annie, you're young, andyou don't have a very firm grip onpolitics. I suggest you reserveyour opinions for some other time.
ANAKIN;Sorry, M'lady. I was only tryingto
PADMÉ;Annie! No!
ANAKIN;Please don't call me that.
PADMÉ;What?
ANAKIN;Annie
PADMÉ;I've always called you that itis your name, isn't it?
ANAKIN;It's Anakin. When you say Annieit's like I'm still a littleboy and I'm not.
PADMÉ;I'm sorry, Anakin. It's impossibleto deny you'vethat you've grown up.
ANAKIN;Master Obi-Wan manages not to seeit
PADMÉ;Mentors have a way of seeing moreof our faults than we would like.It's the only way we grow.
ANAKIN;Don't get me wrong Obi-Wan isa great mentor. As wise as MasterYoda and as powerful as MasterWindu. I am truly thankful to behis apprentice. Only althoughI'm a Padawan learner, in someways a lot of ways I'm aheadof him. I'm ready for the trials.I know I am! He knows it too. Hebelieves I'm too unpredictableOther Jedi my age have gonethrough the trials and made itI know I started my traininglate but he won't let me moveon.
PADMÉ;That must be frustrating.
ANAKIN;It's worse he's overlycritical. He never listens! Hejust doesn't understand! It's notfair!
PADMÉ;I'm sorry You sounded exactlylike that little boy I once knew,when he didn't get his way.
ANAKIN;I'm not whining! I'm not.
PADMÉ;I didn't say it to hurt you.
ANAKIN;I know
PADME;Anakin
PADMÉ;Don't try to grow up too fast.
ANAKIN;I am grown up. You said ityourself.
PADMÉ;Please don't look at me like that.
ANAKIN;Why not?
PADMÉ;Because I can see what you'rethinking.
ANAKIN;Ahh so, you have Jedi powerstoo?
PADMÉ;It makes me feel uncomfortable.
ANAKIN;Sorry, M'lady.
CAPTAIN TYPHO;Be safe, m'lady.
PADMÉ;Thank you, Captain. Take goodcare of Dorme the threat's onyou two now.
DORME;He'll be safe with me.
PADMÉ;You'll be fine.
DORME;It's not me, M'Lady. I worryabout you. What if they realiseI'm not you?
PADMÉ;Then my Jedi protector will haveto prove how grown up he is.
OBI-WAN;Anakin, you stay put on Naboo.Do not attract any attention. Doabsolutely nothing withoutchecking in with me or the Council.
ANAKIN;Yes, Master.
OBI-WAN;I will get to the bottom of thisplot quickly, M'Lady. You'll beback here in no time.
PADMÉ;I will be most grateful for yourspeed, Master Jedi.
ANAKIN;Time to go.
PADMÉ;I know. 
OBI-WAN;May the Force be with you.
ANAKIN;May the Force be with you, Master.
PADMÉ;Suddenly, I'm afraid
ANAKIN;I'm kinda scared too. This is myfirst assignment on my own.
PADMÉ;There's nothing to worry aboutwe have Artoo with us.
OBI-WAN;I hope he doesn't try anythingfoolish.
CAPTAIN TYPHO;I'd be more concerned about herdoing something, than him.
PK-4;Place the subject for analysis onthe sensot tray, please.
OBI-WAN;It's a toxic dart. I need to knowwhere it came from and who made it.
PK-4;One moment, please.
PK-4;As you can see on your screen,subject weapon does not exist inany known culture. Markingscannot be identified. Probabltself-made by a warrior notassociated with any known society.
OBI-WAN;Excuse me? Could you try againplease?
PK-4;Master Jedi, our records are verythorough. they cover eightpercent of the galaxy. If I can'ttell you where it came from,nobody can.
OBI-WAN;Thanks for your assistance! Youmay not be able to figure thisout, but I think I know someonewho might.
SERVER;Keep moving! Keep moving!
FOOD SERVER;Hey! No Droids!
ANAKIN;No, no, Mom, no
ANAKIN;What?
PADMÉ;You seemed to be having anightmare.
PADMÉ;Are you hungry?
ANAKIN;Thank you.
PADMÉ;We went into lightspeed a whileago.
ANAKIN;I look forward to seeing Nabooagain. I've thought about it everyday since I left. It's by far themost beautiful place I've everseen
PADMÉ;"You were just a little boy then.It may not be as you remember it;time changes your perception."
ANAKIN;I think time has given me muchmore mature feelings to enhance myperception.
PADMÉ;It must be difficult having swornyour life to the Jedi not beingable to visit the places youlike or do the things youlike
ANAKIN;Or be with the people I love.
PADMÉ;Are you allowed to love? Ithought that was forbidden for aJedi.
ANAKIN;Attachment is forbidden.Possession is forbidden.Compassion, which I would defineas unconditional love, is centralto a Jedi's life, so you might saywe're encouraged to love.
PADMÉ;You have changed so much
ANAKIN;You haven't changed a bit. You'reexactly the way I remember you inmy dreams. I doubt if Naboo haschanged much either.
PADMÉ;It hasn't
ANAKIN;I can't wait to breathe the sweetbreeze that comes off the rollinghills. Whenever I try tovisualise the Force, those hillsare what I see.
ANAKIN;I love Naboo.
PADMÉ;Were you dreaming about youmother earlier, weren't you?
ANAKIN;Yes I left Tatooine so longago, my memory of her is fading.I don't want to lose it. RecentlyI've been seeing her in mydreams vivid dreams scarydreams. I worry about her.
HERMIONE;Can I help ya?
OBI-WAN;I'm looking for Dexter.
HERMIONE BAGWA;Waddya want him for?
OBI-WAN;He's not in trouble. It'spersonal.
HERMIONE BAGWA;Someone to see ya, honeyA Jedi, by the looks of him.
DEXTER JETTSTER;Obi-Wan!
OBI-WAN;Hey, Dex.
DEXTER JETTSTER;Take a seat! Be right with ya!
HERMIONE BAGWA;You want a cup of ardees?
OBI-WAN;Thank you.
DEXTER JETTSTER;Hey, ol' buddy!
OBI-WAN;Hey, Dex.
DEXTER JETTSTER;So, my friend. What can I do forya?
OBI-WAN;You can tell me what this is.
DEXTER JETTSTER;Well, whattaya know
DEXTER JETTSTER;I ain't seen one of these since Iwas prospecting on Subterrelbeyond the Outer Rim!
OBI-WAN;Do you know where it came from?
DEXTER JETTSTER;This baby belongs to them cloners.What you got here is a KaminoKyberdart.
OBI-WAN;Kamino Kyberdart I wonder whyit didn't show up in any analysisarchive.
DEXTER JETTSTER;It's these funny little cuts onthe side give it awayThose analysis droids you've gotover there only focus on symbols,you know. I should think you Jediwould have more respect for thedifference between knowledge andwisdom.
OBI-WAN;Well, Dex, if droids could think, wewouldn't be here, would we?Kamino doesn't sound familiar.Is it part of the Republic?
DEXTER JETTSTER;No, it's beyond the Outer Rim.I'd say about twelve parsecsoutside the Rishi Maze, toward thesouth. It should be easy to find,even for those droids in yourarchive to find. Those Kaminoanskeep to themselves. They'recloners. Damned good ones, too.
OBI-WAN;Cloners? Are they friendly?
DEXTER JETTSTER;It depends.
OBI-WAN;On what, Dex?
DEXTER JETTSTER;On how good your manners areand how big your pocketbook is
ANAKIN;If I grew up here, I don't thinkI'd ever leave.
PADMÉ;I doubt that.
ANAKIN;No, really. When I started mytraining, I was very homesick andvery lonely. This city and my Momwere the only pleasant things Ihad to think about The problemwas, the more I thought about myMom, the worse I felt. But Iwould feel better if I thoughtabout the palace - the way itshimmers in the sunlight - the waythe air always smells of flowers
PADMÉ;and the soft sound of thedistant waterfalls. The firsttime I saw the Capital, I was veryyoung I'd never seen awaterfall before. I though theywere so beautiful I neverdreamed one day I'd live in thepalace.
ANAKIN;Well, tell me, did you dream ofpower and politics when you werea little girl?
PADMÉ;"No! That was the last thing Ithought of. My dream was to helpin the ""Refugee Relief Movement.""I never thought of running forelected office. But the morehistory I studied, the more Irealised how much good politicianscould do. So when I was eight, Ijoined the ""ApprenticeLegislators"", then later on becamea Senatorial advisor, with such apassion that, before I knew it, Iwas elected Queen. Partly becauseI scored so high on my educationcertificate, but for the most partit was my conviction that reformwas possible. I wasn't theyoungest Queen ever elected, butnow that I think back on it, I'mnot sure I was old enough. I'm notsure I was ready."
ANAKIN;The people you served thought youdid a good job. I heard theytried to amend the Constitution soyou could stay in office.
PADMÉ;Popular rule is not democracy,Annie. It gives the people whatthey want, not what they need.And, truthfully, I was relievedwhen my two terms were up. Sowere my parents. They worriedAbout me during the blockade andcouldn't wait for it all to beover. Actually, I was hoping tohave a family by now Mysisters have the most amazing,wonderful kids but when theQueen asked me to serve asSenator, I couldn't refuse her.
ANAKIN;I agree! I think the Republicneeds you I'm glad you choseto serve. I feel things are goingto happen in our generation thatwill change the galaxy in profoundways.
PADMÉ;I think so too.
QUEEN JAMILLIA;We've been worried about you.I'm so glad you're safe, Padmé.
PADMÉ;Thank you, Your Highness. I onlyWish I could have served youbetter by staying on Coruscant forthe vote.
SIO BIBBLE;Given the circumstances, Senator,you know it was the only decisionHer Highness could have made.
QUEEN JAMILLIA;How many systems have joined CountDooku and the separatists?
PADMÉ;About two hundred. And more areleaving the Republic every day.If the Senate votes to create anarmy, I'm sure it's going to pushus into a civil war.
SIO BIBBLE;It's unthinkable! There hasn'tbeen a full-scale war since theformation of the Republic!
QUEEN JAMILLIA;Do you see any way, throughnegotiations, to bring theseparatists back into the Republic?
PADMÉ;Not if they feel threatened. Theseparatists don't have an army,but if they are provoked, theywill move to defend themselves.I'm sure of that. And with no timeor money to build an army, myguess is they will turn to theCommerce Guilds or the TradeFederation for help.
QUEEN JAMILLIA;The armies of commerce! Why hasNothing been done in the Senateto restrain them?
PADMÉ;I'm afraid that, despite theChancellor's best efforts, thereare still many bureaucrats,judges, and even Senators on thepayrolls of the Guilds.
SIO BIBBLE;It's outrageous! After all ofthose hearings, and the four trials inthe Supreme Court, Nute Gunray isstill the Viceroy of the TradeFederation. Do those moneymongers control everything?
QUEEN JAMILLIA;Remember, Counsellor, the courtswere able to reduce theFederation's armies. That's amove in the rightdirection.
PADMÉ;There are rumours, Your Highness,that the Federation Army was notreduced as they were ordered.
ANAKIN;The Jedi have not been allowed toinvestigate. It would be to be toodangerous for the economy, we weretold.
QUEEN JAMILLIA;We must keep our faith in theRepublic. The day we stopbelieving democracy can work isthe day we lose it.
PADMÉ;Let's pray that day never comes.
QUEEN JAMILLIA;In the meantime, we must consideryour own safety.
SIO BIBBLE;What is your suggestion, MasterJedi?
PADMÉ;Anakin's not a Jedi yet, Counsellor.He's still a Padawan learner. Iwas thinking
ANAKIN;Hey, hold on a minute!
PADMÉ;Excuse me! I was thinking I wouldstay in the Lake Country. Thereare some places up there that arevery isolated.
ANAKIN;Excuse me?! I am in charge ofsecurity here, M'Lady.
PADMÉ;Annie, my life is at risk, andthis is my home. I know it verywell that is why we're here.I think it would be wise for youto take advantage of my knowledgein this instance.
ANAKIN;Sorry, M'Lady.
SIO BIBBLE;She is right. The Lake Country isthe most remote part of Naboo.Not many people and a clear viewof the surrounding terrain.
QUEEN JAMILLIA;Perfect. It's settled then.
QUEEN JAMILLIA;Padmé, I had an audience with yourfather yesterday. I told him whatwas happening. He hopes you willvisit your mother before youleave your family's veryworried about you.
JOCASTA NU;Did you call for assistance?
OBI-WAN;Yes yes, I did
JOCASTA NU;He has a powerful face, doesn'the? He was one of the mostbrilliant Jedi I have had theprivilege of knowing.
OBI-WAN;I never understood why he quit.Only twenty Jedi have ever leftthe Order.
JOCASTA NU;The Lost Twenty and Count Dookuwas the most recent and the mostpainful. No one likes to talkabout it. His leaving was a greatloss to the Order.
OBI-WAN;What happened?
JOCASTA NU;Well, one might say, he was alwaysa bit out of step with thedecisions of the Council muchlike your old Master, Qui-Gon Jinn.
OBI-WAN;Really?
JOCASTA NU;Oh, yes. They were alike in manyways. Very individual thinkersidealists
JOCASTA NU;He was always striving to becomea more powerful Jedi. He wantedto be the best. With a lightsaber,in the old style of fencing, hehad no match. His knowledge ofthe Force was unique. In theend, I think he left because helost faith in the Republic. Hebelieved that politics werecorrupt, and he felt the Jedibetrayed themselves by serving thepoliticians. He always had veryhigh expectations of government.He disappeared for nine or tenyears, then he just showed uprecently as the head of theseparatist movement.
OBI-WAN;Interesting I'm still not sureI understand.
JOCASTA NU;Well, I'm sure you didn't call meover here for a history lesson.Are you having a problem, MasterKenobi?
OBI-WAN;Yes, I'm trying to find a planetsystem called Kamino. It doesn'tseem to show upon any of thearchive charts.
JOCASTA NU;Kamino? It's not a system I'Mfamiliar with Let me see
JOCASTA NU;Are you sure you have the rightco-ordinates?
OBI-WAN;According to my information, itshould be in this quadrantsomewhere just south of theRishi Maze.
JOCASTA NU;No co-ordinates? It sounds like thekind of directions you'd get froma street tout some old miner orFurbog trader.
OBI-WAN;All three actually.
JOCASTA NU;Are you sure it exists?
OBI-WAN;Absolutely.
JOCASTA NU;Let me do a gravitational scan.
JOCASTA NU;There are some inconsistencieshere. Maybe the planet you'relooking for was destroyed.
OBI-WAN;Wouldn't that be on record?
JOCASTA NU;It ought to be. Unless it was veryrecent. I hate to say it, but it lookslike the system you're searchingfor doesn't exist.
OBI-WAN;That's impossible perhaps thearchives are incomplete.
JOCASTA NU;The archives are comprehensive andtotally secure, my young Jedi.One thing you may be absolutelysure of - if an item does notappear in our records, it does notexist!
PADME;There's my house!
PADME;What? Don't say you're shy!
ANAKIN;No, but I
RYOO & POOJA;Aunt Padme!! Aunt Padme!!
PADME;Ryoo!! Pooja!!
PADME;I'm so happy to see you! This isAnakin. Anakin, this is Ryoo, andthis is Pooja.
RYOO & POOJA;Artoo!!!
SOLA;They're eating over at JevNarran's later, Mom. They justhad a snack. They'll be fine.
PADME;Anakin, this is my sister, Sola.
SOLA;Hello, Anakin.
ANAKIN;Hello.
JOBAL;You're just in time for dinner. Ihope you're hungry, Anakin.
ANAKIN;A little.
PADME;He's being polite, Mom. We'restarving.
RUWEE;You came to the right place at theright time. Sit down, son.
JOBAL;Honey, it's so good to see yousafe. We were so worried.
RUWEE;Dear
JOBAL;I know, I know but I had to sayit. Now it's done.
SOLA;Well, this is exciting! Do youknow, Anakin, you're the firstboyfriend my sister's ever broughthome?
PADME;Sola!! He isn't my boyfriend!He's a Jedi assigned by the Senateto protect me.
JOVAL;A bodyguard?! Oh, Padme! Theydidn't tell us it was that serious!
PADME;It's not, Mom, I promise.Anyway, Anakin's a friend. I'veknown him for years. Rememberthat little boy who was with theJedi during the blockade crisis?
PADME;He grew up.
JOBAL;Honey, when are you going tosettle down? Haven't you hadenough of that life? I certainlyhave!
PADME;Mom, I'm not in any danger.
RUWEE;Is she?
ANAKIN;Yes I'm afraid she is.
PADME;But not much.
RUWEE;Sometimes I wish I'd traveledmore but I must say, I'm happyhere.
ANAKIN;Padme tells me you teach at theuniversity?
RUWEE;Yes, and before that, I was abuilder. I also worked for theRefugee Relief Movement, when Iwas very young.
SOLA;Why haven't you told us about him?
PADMÉ;What's there to talk about?  He'sjust a boy.
SOLA;A boy? Have you seen the way helooks at you?
PADMÉ;Sola - stop it!
SOLA;It's obvious he has feelings foryou. Are you saying, little babysister, that you haven't noticed?
PADMÉ;I'm not your baby sister, Sola.Anakin and I are friends ourrelationship is strictlyprofessional.Mom, would you tell her to stop it?
SOLA;Well, maybe you haven't noticedthe way he looks at you. I thinkyou're afraid to.
PADMÉ;Cut it out.
JOBAL;Sola's just concerned we allare.
PADMÉ;Oh, Mom, you're impossible. WhatI'm doing is important.
JOBAL;You've done your service, Padmé.It's time you had a life of yourown. You're missing so much!
RUWEE;Now tell me, son. How serious isthis thing? How much danger is mydaughter really in?
ANAKIN;There have been two attempts onher life. Chances are there'll bemore. My Master is tracking downthe assassins. I'm sure he'll findout who they are. This situation,won't last long.
RUWEE;I don't want anything to happen toher.
ANAKIN;I don't either.
PADME;Don't worry, this won't take long.
ANAKIN;I just want to get there beforedark.
ANAKIN;You still live at home.
PADME;I move around so much, I've neverhad a place of my own. Officialresidences have no warmth. I feelgood here. I feel at home.
ANAKIN;I never had a real home. Home wasalways where my Mom was.
ANAKIN;Is this you?
PADME;That was when I went with theRelief Group to Shadda-Bi-Boran.Their sun was imploding, and theplanet was dying. I was helpingto relocate the children. Seethat little one I'm holding? Hisname was N'a-kee-tula, which meanssweethear. He was so full of life,. All those kids were. I dideverything I could to save him,but he died they all did. Theywere never able to adapt tolive off their native planet.
PADME;My first day as an ApprenticeLegislator. Notice the difference?
YODA;Don't think feel be as onewith the Force. Help you, it will.Younglings - enough! A visitor wehave. Welcome him.
YODA;Master Obi-Wan Kenobi, meet themighty Bear Clan.
CHILDREN;Welcome, Master Obi-Wan!
OBI-WAN;I am sorry to disturb you, Master.
YODA;What help to you, can I be?
OBI-WAN;I’m looking for a planet describedto me by an old friend. I trusthim. But the system doesn’t showup on the archive maps.
YODA;An interesting puzzle. Gatherround the map reader, younglings.Master Obi-Wan has lost a planet.Find it, we will try
OBI-WAN;This is where it ought to bebut it isn’t. Gravity is pullingall the stars in this area inwardto this spot. There should be astar here but there isn’t.
YODA;Most interesting. Gravity’ssilhouette remains, but the starand all its planets havedisappeared. How can this be?
JEDI CHILD JACK;Because someone erased it from thearchive memory.
CHILDREN;That’s right! Yes! That’s whathappened! Someone erased it!
JEDI CHILD MAY;If the planet blew up, the gravitywould go away.
YODA;Truly wonderful, the mind of achild is. Uncluttered. To thecentre of the pull of gravity go,and find your planet you will.
OBI-WAN;But Master Yoda who could haveerased information from thearchives? That’s impossible,isn’t it?
YODA;Much harder to answer, thatquestion is.
PADMÉ;When I was in Level Three, we usedto come here for school retreat.See that island? We used to swimthere every day. I love the water.
ANAKIN;I do too. I guess it comes fromgrowing up on a desert planet.
PADMÉ;We used to lie on the sand andlet the sun dry us and try toguess the names of the birdssinging.
ANAKIN;I don’t like sand. It’s coarseand rough and irritating, and itgets everywhere. Not like here.Here everything’s soft andsmooth
PADMÉ;There was a very old man who livedon the island. He used to makeglass out of sand - and vases andnecklaces out of the glass. Theywere magical.
ANAKIN;Everything here is magical.
PADMÉ;You could look into the glass andsee the water. The way it ripplesand moves. It looked so realbut it wasn’t.
ANAKIN;Sometimes, when you believesomething to be real, it becomesreal. Real enough, anyway
PADMÉ;I used to think if you looked toodeeply into glass, you wouldlose yourself.
ANAKIN;I think it's true
PADMÉ;I shouldn't have done that.
ANAKIN;I'm sorry. When I'm around you,my mind is no longer my own.
PADMÉ;It's the situation the stress
ANAKIN;the view.
MACE WINDU;Be wary, this disturbance in theForce is growing stronger.
OBI-WAN;I am concerned for my Padawan. Heis not ready to be on his own.
YODA;The Council is confident in this decision,Obi-Wan.
MACE;He has exceptional skills. TheCouncil is confident in itsdecision, Obi-Wan. If theprophecy is true, he weill be theone to bring balance to the Force.
OBI-WAN;But he still has much to learn.And his abilities have made himwell arrogant. I realise nowwhat you and Master Yoda knew fromthe beginning the boy was tooold to start the training and
MACE WINDU;There's something else?
OBI-WAN;Master, he should not have beengiven this assignment. I'm afraidAnakin won't be able to protectthe Senator. 
MACE WINDU;Why?
OBI-WAN;He has a an emotionalconnection with her. It's beenthere since he was boy. Nowhe's confused distracted.
MACE-WINDU;Obi-Wan, you must have faith thathe will take the right path.
OBI-WAN;Has Master Yoda gained any insightinto whether or not this war willcome about?
MACE WINDU;Probing the Dark Side is adangerous process. He could be inseclusion for days May theforce be with you.
PADME;You did that?
ANAKIN;What?
PADME;That! Now stop it!
PADME;Anakin!!
ANAKIN;I'm not really supposed to dothat for fun, I mean. IfMaster Obi-Wan were here, he'd bevery grumpy.
ANAKIN;May I tell you something?
PADME;I don't know.
ANAKIN;Then how can I tell you?
PADME;Maybe you should use your Jediintuition.
ANAKIN;It doesn't work around you. Mymind is always a muddle I canonly think of you.
PADME;Anakin, don't
ANAKIN;From the moment I met you, allthose years ago, a day hasn't goneby when I haven't thought of you.And now that I'm close to you again,I'm in agony. The closer I get toyou, the worse it gets. Thethought of not being with youmskes my stomach turn over - mymouth goes dry. I feel dizzy. Ican't breathe. I'm haunted by thekiss you should never have givenme. My heart is beating, hopingthat kiss will not become a scar.You are in my very soul,tormenting me. What can I do? Iwill do anything you ask
ANAKIN;If you are suffering as much as Iam, tell me.
PADME;I can't. We can't. It's justnot possible.
ANAKIN;Anything's possible. Padme,please listen
PADME;You listen. We live in a realworld. Come back to it. You'restudying to become a Jedi Knight.I'm a Senator. If you follow yourthoughts through to conclusion,they will take us to a place wecannot go regardless of the waywe feel about each other.
ANAKIN;Then you do feel something!There's an extraordinaryconnection between us. You can'tdeny that.
PADME;Annie, it doesn't make anydifference. Jedi aren't allowedto marry. You swore an oath,remember? You'd be expelled fromthe Order. I will not let yougive up your responsibilitiesyour future, for me.
ANAKIN;I was destined to be a Jedi. Idon't think I could be anythingelse. But you are asking me to berational. That is something Iknow I cannot do. I wish I couldwish my feelings away but Ican't.
PADME;I am not going to give into this.I'm not going to throw my lifeaway. I have more important thingsto do than fall in love.
ANAKIN;It wouldn't have to be that waywe could keep it a secret.
PADME;Then we'd be living a lie - one wecouldn't keep even if we wantedto. Mt sister saw it. So did mymother. I couldn't do that.Could you, Anakin? Could you livelike that?
ANAKIN;No, you're right. It woulddestroy us.
TAUN WE;Welcome to Tipoca City, MasterJedi.
TAUN WE;Everything is ready. The PrimeMinister expects you.
OBI-WAN;I'm expected?
TAUN WE;Of course! He is anxious to seeyou. After all these years, wewere beginning to think youweren't coming. Now please, thisway!
TAUN WE;May I present Lama Su, PrimeMinister of Kamino and this isMaster Jedi
OBI-WAN;Obi-Wan Kenobi.
LAMA SU;Please
LAMA SU;I trust you are going to enjoyyour stay. We are most happy youhave arrived at the best part ofthe season.
OBI-WAN;You make me feel most welcome.
LAMA SU;And now to business. You will bedelighted to hear we are onschedule. Two hundred thousandunits are ready, with anothermillion well on the way.
OBI-WAN;That is good news.
LAMA SU;Please tell your Master Sido-Dyasthat we have every confidence hisorder will be met on time and infull. He is well, I hope?
OBI-WAN;I'm sorry Master - ?
LAMA SU;Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas. He's stilla leading member of the JediCouncil, is he not?
OBI-WAN;Oh, yes. Sido-Dyas.
LAMA SU;You must be anxious to inspect theunits for yourself.
OBI-WAN;That's why I'm here.
PADMÉ;I don't know
ANAKIN;Sure you do you just don't wantto tell me.
PADMÉ;Are you going to use one of yourJedi mind tricks on me?
ANAKIN;They only work on the weak-minded.You are anything but weak-minded.
PADMÉ;All right his name was Palo.I was twelve. We were both in theLegislative Youth Program. He wasa few years older then I verycute dark curly hair dreamyeyes.
ANAKIN;All right, I get the picturewhatever happened to him?
PADMÉ;I went on to become a Queen. Hewent on to become an artist.
ANAKIN;Maybe he was the smart one.
PADME;You really don't like politicians,do you?
ANAKIN;I like two or three, but I'm notreally sure about one of them.I don't think the system works.
PADME;How would you have it work?
ANAKIN;We need a system where thepoliticians sit down and discussthe problems, agree what's in thebest interests of all the people,and then do it.
PADME;That is exactly what we do. Thetrouble is that people don'twlways agree. In fact, theyhardly ever do.
ANAKIN;Then they should be made to.
PADME;By whom? Who's going to make them?
ANAKIN;I don't know. Someone.
PADME;You?
ANAKIN;Of course not me.
PADME;But someone.
ANAKIN;Someone wise.
PADME;That sounds an awful lot like adictatorship to me.
ANAKIN;Well, if it works
PADMÉ;You're making fun of me.
ANAKIN;On no, I'd be much too frightenedto tease a Senator.
PADMÉ;You're so bad!
ANAKIN;You're always so serious. Alwayscarrying the weight of theuniverse on your shoulders.
LAMA SU;Magnificent, aren't they?
LAMA SU;We modified their geneticstructure to make them lessindependent than the originalhost. As a result they aretotally obedient, taking any orderwithout question.
OBI-WAM;Who was the original host?
LAMA SU;A bounty hunter called Jango Fett.We felt a Jedi would be theperfect choice, but Sido-Dyas hand-picked Jango Fett himself.
OBI-WAN;Where is this bounty hunter now?
LAMA SU;Oh, we keep him here. After a fewhundred thousand clones, thegenetic pattern starts to fade, sowe take a fresh supply. He liveshere, but he's free to come and goas he pleases.
LAMA SU;Apart from his pay, which isconsiderable, Fett demanded onlyone thing - an unaltered clone forhimself. Curious isn't it?
OBI-WAN;Unaltered?
LAMA SU;Pure genetic replication. Notampering with the structure tomake it more docile and nogrowth acceleration
OBI-WAN;I would like to meet this JangoFett.
TAUN WE;I would be most happy to arrangeit, for you.
OBI-WAN;You mentioned growthacceleration
LAMA SU;Oh yes, it's essential.Otherwise, a mature clone wouldtake a lifetime to grow. Now, wecan do it in half the time. Thoseitems you saw on the parade groundwere started ten years ago, whenSido-dyas first placed the order,and they're already mature
OBI-WAN;And these?
LAMA SU;About five years ago.
LAMA SU;They're immensely superior todroids, capable of independentthought and action.
OBI-WAN;Very impressive.
LAMA SU;I'd hoped you would be pleased. 
OBI-WAN;Tell me, prime minister, when myMaster Sido-dyas first contactedyou, did he say the order wasfor himself or?
LAMA SU;Himself? Of course not. Thisarmy is for the Republic?
OBI-WAN;The Repubic?
LAMA SU;We are also very much agasint thisCount Dooku and his seccessionistmovement. We are proud to be ofhelp to the Republic.
TAUN WE;I have arranged for you to meetJango Fett in the morning. Sleepwell.
OBI-WAN;Arfour, Arfour
OBI-WAN;"Arfour, relay this, ""scramble codefive,"" to Courscant: care of ""theold folks home."""
OBI-WAN;I've never heard of a Jedicalled Sido-Dyas, have you, Master?
MACE WINDU;No. Whoever placed that order wasnot a Jedi, I can assure you.
OBI-WAN ;I have a strong feeling that thisbounty hunter is the assassinwe're looking for.
YODA;Who he is working for discoverthat, you must.
OBI-WAN ;I will, Master, and I will alsofind out more about this clonearmy May The Force
WINDU ;A clone army! Ordered by someonein the Senate perhaps Someone'sout to start a war.
YODA;Inform the chancellor of this, wemust.
WINDU;Who do you think this impostorSido-Dyas, could be?
ANAKIN;NoNoNoMom!Don't,no, don't!
ANAKIN;Don't go.
PAMDE;I don't want to disturb you.
ANAKIN;Your presence is soothing.
PADME;You had a nightmare again lastnight.
ANAKIN;Jedi don't have nightmares.
PADME;I heard you.
ANAKIN;I saw my mother. I saw her asclearly as I see you now. She'ssuffering, Padme. She is inpainThey're killing herI know I'm disobeying my mandateto protect you, Senator. I know Iwill be punished and possiblythrown out of the Jedi Order, butI must go. I have to help her!I'm sorry, Padme. I don't have achoice.
PADME;Annie, I told you I wouldn't letyou give up your future for me.I'll go with you. That way youcan continue to protect me, andyou won't be disobeying yourmandate.
ANAKIN;What about Master Obi-wan?
PADME;I guess we won't tell him, will we?
TAUN WE;Boba, is your father here?
TAUN WE;May we see him?
BOBA FETT;Sure.
BOBA FETT;Dad! Taun We's here!
TAUN WE;Welcome back, Jango. Was yourtrip productive?
JANGO FETT;Fairly.
TAUN WE;This is Jedi Master, Obi-WanKenobi. He's come to check on ourprogress.
JANGO FETT;That right?
OBI-WAN;Your clones are very impressive.You must be very proud.
JANGO FETT;I'm just a simple man, trying tomake my way in the universe,Master Jedi.
OBI-WAN;Aren't we all?
OBI-WAN;Ever made your way as far into theinterior as Coruscant?
JANGO;Once or twice.
OBI-WAN;Recently?
JANGO;Possibly
OBI-WAN;Then you must know Master Sido-Dyas?
JANGO;Boba, close the door.
JANGO;Master who?
OBI-WAN;Sido-Dyas. Isn’t he the Jedi whohired you for this job?
JANGO;Never heard of him. I wasrecuited by a man called DarthTyranus on one of the moons ofBogden.
OBI-WAN;No? I thought
TAUN WE;Sido-Dyas told us to expect him.And he showed up just when yourJedi Master said he would. Wehave kept the Jedi’s involvementa secret until your arrival, justas your Master requested.
OBI-WAN;Curious
JANGO;Do you like your army?
OBI-WAN;It seems to me it's your army -being that they are all clones ofyou.
JANGO;They'll do their job well, I'llguarantee that.
OBI-WAN;I look forward to seeing them inaction. Thank you for your time,Jango.
JANGO;Always a pleasure to meet a Jedi.
BOBA;What is it, Dad?
ANAKIN;Wait, please.
WATTO;No, not that one - that one!
ANAKIN;Excuse me, Watto.
WATTO;What?
ANAKIN;I said excuse me.
WATTO;Shut down.
WATTO;What? I don't know you What canI do for you? You look like aJedi. Whatever it is I didn'tdo it.
ANAKIN;Let me help you with that.
ANAKIN;I'm looking for Shmi Skywalker.
WATTO;Annie?? Little Annie?? Naaaah!!
WATTO;You are Annie! It is you! Youlittle womp rat.
WATTO;You sure sprouted Weehoo! AJedi! Waddya know? Hey, maybeyou couldda help wit somedaedbeats who owe
ANAKIN;My mother
WATTO;Oh, yeah. Shmi she's not mineno more. I sold her.
ANAKIN;Sold her
WATTO;Years ago. Sorry, Anne, but youknow, business is business.Sold her to a moisture farmernamed Lars. Least I think it wasLars. Believe it or not, I heardhe freed her and married her. Canya beat that?
ANAKIN;Do you know where they are?
WATTO;Long way from here someplaceover on the other side of MosEisley, I think
ANAKIN;I'd like to know.
WATTO;Yeah sure absolutely. Let'sgo look in my records.
LAMA SU;Tell your Council the firstbattalions are ready. And remindthem that if they need moretroops, we will need time to growthem.
OBI-WAN;I won't forget.
BOBA FETT;Dad!!
PADME;Stay with the ship, Artoo.
C-3PO;Good evening. May I help you?
ANAKIN;Threepio?
C-3PO;Oh, my oh, my! MasterAnakin! My goodness, I can hardlybelieve it! And this must be MissPadme.
PADME;Hello, Threepio.
ANAKIN;I've come to see my mother.
C-3PO;Oh, dear! I'm so terribly sorry,Master Annie.
PADME;Threepio, what's happened?
C-3PO;I think we'd better go inside.
C-3PO;Master Lars - Master Owen!Somebody to see you!
ANAKIN;I'm Anakin Skywalker. I'm herelooking for my mother.
OWEN;Owen Lars I guess I'm yourstep-brother.This is my girlfriend, Beru.
BERU;Hello.
PADME;I'm Padme.
OWEN;I had a feeling you might show upsome day.
ANAKIN;Is my mother here?
CLIEGG;No, she's not.
CLIEGG;Cliegg Lars. Shmi is my wifeCome on inside. We have a lot totalk about.
CLIEGG ;It was just before dawn. Theycame out of nowhere. A huntingparty of Tusekn Raiders.
CLIEGG;Your mother had gone out early,like she always did, to pickmushrooms that grow on thevaporatos. From the tracks, shewas about halfway when theytook her. Those Tuskens walk likemen, but they're vicious, mindlessmonsters. Thirty of us went outafter her. Four of us came back.Three more are still out therelooking. I'd be with them,only I just couldn't ride anymore until I heal.
CLIEGG;This isn't the way I wanted tomeet you, son. This isn't howyour mother and I planned it. Idon't want to give up on her, butshe's been gone a month. There'slittle hope she's lasted this long.
OWEN;Where are you going?
ANAKIN;To find my mother.
PADME;No, Annie!
CLIEGG;She's daed, son. Accept it.
ANAKIN;I can feel her pain, and I willfind her. I know she's alive.
ANAKIN;You are going to have to stayhere. These are good people,Padme. You'll be safe.
OWEN;Take my speeder bike.
PADME;Anakin
ANAKIN;I trust you'll watch over her,Owen.
OWEN;Don't worry.
ANAKIN;I won't be long.
JANGO FETT;Nearly there, son.
BOBA FETT;Dad, look!!
JANGO FETT;Hang on!
BOBA FETT;Dad! Watch out!
JANGO FETT;Stay calm, son. We'll be fine.That Jedi won't be able to followus through this.
BOBA FETT;Got him! Yeahhhhh!
JANGO FETT;We won't see him again.
C-3PO;Please don't leave us, Miss Padme.These people need your help.
PADME;I'm not leaving, Threepio. I justcan't sleep.
C-3PO;That's something I cannot relateto. As a Protocol Droid, I'meither active or inactive.There's no in-between.
PADME;I guess you're lucky.
C-3PO;Do you really think so..? Isuppose I shouldn't expect
PADME;You're not happy here?
C-3PO;Oh, I'm not unhappy and mymasters here ar so kind Iwouldn't wish to trouuble them,it's just being like thiswell, it's embarrassing.
PADME;Being like what?
C-3PO;Naked. If you pardon theexpression. You see, when MasterAnnie made me, he never quitefound the time to give me anyouter covering. It's sohumiliating. How would you like itif you had to go around with allyour circuits showing?
PADME;I guess I wouldn't like it at all.
C-3PO;Of course you wouldn't. Nobodywould. It's simply not protocol.
PADME;Maybe we can do something about it.
C-3PO;I don't think so. Only MasterAnnie
PADME;Why not? They seem to have a boxof old coverings here.
C-3PO;Oh? How observant of you, MissPadme. Of course, I'm just notmechanically minded if you seewhat I mean.
PADME;Let's see, if we put thishere
C-3PO;Ooooh! That's tickles.
PADME;You'll have to be quiet, Threepio.Hold still, please.
ANAKIN;Mom Mom Mom 
SHMI;Annie? Is it you?
ANAKIN;I’m here, Mom. You’re safe. Hangon. I’m going to get you out ofhere
SHMI;I’m so glad to see you,Annie Now I am complete
ANAKIN;Just stay with me, Mom. I’m goingto make you well again.Everything’s going to be fine.
SHMI;You look so handsome. My sonmy grown-up son. I’m so proud ofyou, Annie so proud I missedyou so much I love

OBI-WAN;Starships from the TradeFederation and the Commerce Guildsare taking deliveries of battledroids from the foundries onGeonosis.
BAIL ORGANA;That's outrageous! The treatyforbids the Trade Federation frombuilding up an army. What arethey doing?!
OBI-WAN;The droid foundry seems to beworking at full capacity. I amgoing to go down and investigate.I will bring Jango Fett back homefor interrogation.
PALPATINE;Those Geonosian foundries are partof the Techno Union. We will callin their representatives and askthem a few very pointed questions.
OBI-WAN;One more thing. Jango mentionedhe was recruited by someone namedDarth Tyranus. Any idea who thatmight be?
YODA;With the forename Darth, a Sith hemust be.
MACE WINDU;Our missing apprentice. They areplaying their hand at last.
OBI-WAN;Do you believe he could be themysterious Sido-Dyas, who made thedeal for the clone army?
YODA;Perhaps too many pieces are missingfrom this puzzle, there are.
MACE WINDU;Be careful, Obi-Wan. Thisinvestigation is becoming lessthan routine. Do you need help?
OBI-WAN;Let me see if I can figure outwhat's going on first.
BAIL ORGANA;The Commerce Guilds are preparingfor war there can be no doubtof that.
PALPATINE;Count Dooku must have made atreaty with them.
MACE WINDU;We must stop them soon beforethey're fully ready.
SENATOR ASK AAK;The debate is over, we needthat clone army now!
BAIL ORGANA;Unfortunately, the debate is notover. The Senate will never beable to approve the use of thatarmy before the separatistsattack.
MAS AMEDDA;This is a crisis! If the Senatevotes the Chancellor emergencypowers, he could approve the useof the army in a minute.
PALPATINE;Please, please, I don't wish tohave emergency powers. That's tooextreme a solution. It's akin toa dictatorship. We must rely onthe Jedi. Master Yoda, how manyare available to go to Geonosis?
YODA;Two Hundred, less or more.
BAIL ORGANA;With all due respect for the JediOrder, two hundred will be nomatch for hundreds of thousands ofbattle droids.
MACE WINDU;Patience. We should wait for Obi-Wan to report back. We don't knowthat Count Dooku has made a treatywith the Corporate Alliance, it'sspeculation.
SENATOR ASK AAK;But we must prepare for the worst.I'm going to propose a motiongranting emergency powers to theChancellor at the next session. Wemust not wait!
PALPATINE;Out of the question, Senator! Youand I are too closely aligned.The issue will become partisan anddebates will begin. The proposalmust come from a neutral source.
MAS AMEDDA;If only Senator Amidala were here.
JAR JAR;Supreme Chancellor my augustcolleagues, I would be proud topropose the motion in question.This is a grave situation, and I'msure Senator Amidala, and theQueen of Naboo would agree.
SENATOR ASK AAK;Thank you, Representative Binks.
PALPATINE;If called upon, I will serve. Butit will be the saddest day of mylife.
PADME;There!
C-3PO;Um. How do I look?
OWEN;Great! You look perfect.
C-3PO;Perfect? Oh, Miss Padme, I'm sohappy!Oh, pardon me.
THREEPIO;Thank you.
C-3PO;Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
OWEN;Well, Padme, I think he should beyours from now on I know thatis what my Mom would want.
C-3PO;Oh, my!
BERU ;Come topside, everybody! He'sback! He's back!
OBI-WAN;Alliance have pledged theirarmies to Count Dooku and areforming an Wait! ahattack I don't make itaaaggghhh!
ANAKIN;I'm going after him!
PADME;I thought the first thing he saidwas to retransmit his message toCoruscant.
ANAKIN;Yeah, you're right, you're right.
MACE WINDU;We will deal with Count Dooku. Themost important thing for you,Anakin, is to stay where you are.Protect the Senator at all costs.That is your priority.
ANAKIN;Understood, Master.
PADME;They'll never get there in time tosave him. They have to come halfway across the galaxy. Look,Geonosis is less than a parsec away.
ANAKIN;If he's still alive.
PADME;Annie, are you just going to sithere and let him die?? He's yourfriend your mentor
ANAKIN;He's like my father, but youheard Master Windu. He gave mestrict orders to stay here.
PADME;He gave you strict orders toprotect me
PADME;and I'm going to save Obi-Wan.So if you plan to protect me, youwill have to come along.
MACE WINDU;The longer we wait, the strongerDooku's armies become. We cannotwait for the Senate to make up itsmind about granting the Chancelloremergency powers, in order to beable to use that clone army Wehave the authority to go now. Wemust go now.
YODA;Agreed, Master Windu. Two hundredJedi send. Enough, let's hopethey are.
MAS AMEDDA;Order! Order!!
PALPATINE;In the regrettable absence ofSenator Amidala, the chairrecognises SeniorRepresentative of Naboo, Jar JarBinks.
JAR JAR;Senators, dellow felagates
MAS AMEDDA;Order! The Senate will accord theRepresentative the courtesy of ahearing!
JAR JAR;In response to the direct threatto the Republic from theConfederacy of IndependentSystems, I propose that the Senategives immediate emergency powers tothe Supreme Chancellor.
JAR JAR;Who can deny these are exceptionaltimes? Exceptional times demandexceptional measures!Exceptional measures demandexceptional men!
ORN FREE TAA;We won't support a dictator.
JAR JAR;That is the sentiment every one ofus agrees with! And when theshadow of war has dispersed andthe bright day of liberty hasdawned once again, the power we nowgive to the Supreme Chancellorwill be gladly, and swiftlyreturned. Out ancient libertieswill be restored to us, burnishedeven more brightly than before!
PALPATINE;It is with great reluctance thatI have agreed to this calling. Ilove democracy I love theRepublic. The fact that thiscrisis is demanding I be givenabsolute power to tule over you isevident. But I am mild by natureand have no desire to destroythe democratic process. The power yougive me I will lay down when thiscrisis has abated, I promise you.And all I ask in return is when mycurrent term of office is over,you allow me to reture and liveout my life in peace.
MAS AMEDDA;We shall proceed to the vote. Allthose in favor of grantingemergency powers to the SupremeChancellor, signal ate at thistime those opposed?
ANAKIN;Hey, where are you going?
PADME;To find Obi-Wan.
ANAKIN;No! You're not!
PADME;Let go of me!
ANAKIN;I'm not letting you go out there.It's too dangerous.
PADMÉ;What?!?
ANAKIN;It's my job to protect you. I saidit's too dangerous. You're notgoing, and that's final!
PADMÉ;Don't you give me orders, Annie!I'm a Senator of the GalacticRepublic. You have no authorityto contain me, restrain me, ordirect me! You remember yourplace, young man.Now you can come along and protectme or stay here. It's up to you.
C-3PO;Yes, it is, Artoo. Mostconfusing. One moment they'regenerating a pleasant mutualattraction and the next, waves ofviolent hostility. Even thoughI'm programmed to understand them,I doubt if I ever shall.
PADME;It's empty!
PADME;Wait!
COUNT DOOKU;Senator Amidala, I've heard somuch about you.
PADMÉ;Count Dooku, I assume.
COUNT DOOKU;I'm delighted to meet you atlast. We have a great deal todiscuss, Senator. I hope you cankeep your young Jedi under control.
PADMÉ;Don't worry he's housebroken.
PADMÉ;You are holding a Jedi Knight, Obi-Wan Kenobi. I am formallyrequesting you turn him over tome, now.
DOOKU;He has been convicted ofespionage, Senator, and will beexecuted. In just a few hours, Ibelieve.
PADMÉ;He is an officer of the Republic.You can't do that.
DOOKU;We don't recognise the Republichere, Senator. But if Naboo wereto join our Alliance, I couldeasily hear your plea for clemency.
PADMÉ;And if I don't join yourrebellion, I assume this Jedi withme will also die?
DOOKU;I don't wish to make you to joinour cause against your will,Senator, but you are a rational,honest representative of yourpeople and I assume you want to dowhat's in their best interest.Aren't you fed up with thecorruption, the bureaucrats, thehypocrisy of it all?.. Aren'tyou? Be honest, Senator.
PADMÉ;The ideals are still alive, Count,even if the institution is failing.
DOOKU;You believe in the same ideals webelieve in! The same ideals weare striving to make prominent.
PADMÉ;If what you say is true, youshould stay in the Republic andhelp Chancellor Palpatine putthings right.
DOOKU;The Chancellor means well, M'Ladybut he is incompetent. He haspromised to cut the bureaucracy,but the bureaucrats are strongerthan ever, no? Senator, theRepublic cannot be fixed. It istime to start over. Thedemocratic process in the Republicis a sham, a shell game playedon the voters. It will not be longbefore the cult of greed, calledthe Republic, will lose even thepretext of democracy and freedom.
PADMÉ;I cannot believe that. I will notforsake all I have honoured andworked for and betray theRepublic. I know of your treatieswith the Trade Federation, theCommerce Guilds, and the others,Count. What is happening here isnot government that has beenbought out by business it'sbusiness becoming government!
DOOKU;Are you willing to betray your Jedifriends? Without your co-operationI can do nothing to stop theirexecution.
PADMÉ;What is to happen to me? Am I to beexecuted also?
DOOKU;I wouldn't think of such anoffence. But, there areindividuals who have a stronginterest in your demise, M'lady.It has nothing to do withpolitics, I'm afraid. It's purelypersonal, and they have alreadypaid great sums to have youassassinated. I'm sure they willpush hard to have you included inthe executions. I'm sorry but ifyou are not going to co-operate, Imust turn you over to theGeonosians for justice. I've doneall I can for you.
JANGO FETT;I'll take that weapon.
DOOKU ;You may cause a lot of bloodshed,my young Jedi, but you will notescape.
PADMÉ;Anakin
SUN RIT;You have been charged and foundguilty of Espionage.
POGGLE;Do you have anything to say beforeyour sentence is carried out?
PADMÉ;You are committing an act of war,Archduke. I hope you are preparedfor the consequences.
POGGLE;We build weapons, Senator thatis our business! Of course we'reprepared!
NUTE GUNRAY;Get on with it. Carry out thesentence. I want to see her suffer.
POGGLE;Your other Jedi friend is waitingfor you, Senator. Take them tothe arena!
ANAKIN;Don't be afraid.
PADMÉ;I'm not afraid to die. I've beendying a little bit each day sinceyou came back into my life.
ANAKIN;What are you talking about?
PADMÉ;I love you.
ANAKIN;You love me?! I thought wedecided not to fall in love. Thatwe would be forced to live a lie.That it would destroy our lives
PADMÉ;I think our lives are about to bedestroyed anyway. My love for youis a puzzle, Annie, for which Ihave no answers. I can't controlit and now I don't care. Itruly, deeply love you, and beforewe die I want you to know.
ANAKIN;I have no desire to be cured ofthis love either. Long or short,I vow to spend the rest of my lifewith you.
OBI-WAN;I was beginning to wonder if youhad gotten my message.
ANAKIN;I retransmitted it as yourequested, Master. Then we decidedto come and rescue you.
OBI-WAN;It looks like you're going a goodjob so far.
SUN RIT;The felons before you have beenconvicted of espionage against theSovereign System of Geonosis.Their sentence of death is to becarried out in this public arenahenceforth.
POGGLE;Let the executions begin!
ANAKIN;I have a bad feeling about this.
OBI-WAN;Take the one the left. I'lltake the one on the right.
ANAKIN;What about Padme?
OBI-WAN;It looks like she's already on topof things.
NUTE GUNRAY;Foul!! She can't do that shoother or something!
ANAKIN;You okay?
PADME;Sure! Well, sort of.
ANAKIN;Jump!!!
NUTE GUNRAY;This isn't how it's supposed tobe! Jango, finish her off.
COUNT DOOKU;Patiece, Viceroy she will die.Maybe this is the way it'ssupposed to end.
C-3PO;Yes, it has been rather a longtime. Do you suppose something'shappened to them?
C-3PO;Danger? Oh no, I shouldn't thinkso. It looks a very dull planetto me. They should be backshortly. Just stop worrying, Artoo.
COUNT DOOKU;Master Windu, how pleasant of youto join us. You're just in timefor the moment of truth. I wouldthink these two new boys of yourscould use a little more training.
MACE WINDU;Sorry to disappoint you, Dooku.This party's over.
COUNT DOOKU;Brave, but stupid, my old Jedifriend. You're impossiblyoutnumbered.
MACE WINDU;I don't think so. One Jedi has tobe worth a hundred Geonosians.
COUNT DOOKU;It wasn't the Geonosians I wasthinking about. How well do youthink one Jedi will hold upagainst a thousand battle droids?
C-3PO;I don't hear anything.You're scaring me! Stop imaginingthings!
OBI-WAN;Someone's got to - shut down -these droids.
MACE WINDU;Don't worry! It's being - takencare of!
PLO KOON;We've done it! Now we have achance!
KI-ADI-MUNDI;The system's off but they're stillactive. That's a new feature. Theyare independent of the controlsystem.
COUNT DOOKU;Master Windu!
COUNT DOOKU;You have fought gallantly. Worthyof recognition in the historyarchives of the Jedi Order. Nowit is finished.Surrender - and your lives will be spared.
MACE WINDU;We will not be hostages for you tobarter with Dooku.
COUNT DOOKU;Then, I'm sorry, old friend. Youwill have to be destroyed.
PADME;Look!
YODA;Come on - hurry! Hurry!
YODA;More battalions to the left.Encircle them we must, thendivide.
C-3PO;I'm sure I heard something, thistime. Didn't you? It's probablyjust a celebration
OBI-WAN;Hold on! Look over there
ANAKIN;It's Dooku, go after him!
ANAKIN;Padme!!!
ANAKIN;Put the ship down! Down!
OBI-WAN;No! Forget her. We have to goafter Dooku.
ANAKIN;No we're not!! Land this ship!
OBI-WAN;Don't let your personal feelingsget in the way. We've got a job todo.
ANAKIN;I don't care!.. Go back.
OBI-WAN;Anakin! She's all right! Look.
OBI-WAN;Follow that speeder!
DROID CAPTAIN;Your Excellency!
COUNT DOOKU;That won't be necessary, Captain.Stand down. And leave them to me.
OBI-WAN;We move in together - you slowlyon the
ANAKIN;I'm taking him now!
OBI-WAN;Anakin, no!
ANAKIN;You'll pay for all the Jedi you'vekilled today, Dooku.
COUNT DOOKU;Kenobi, isn't it? As you can see,my Jedi powers are far beyondyours. Now, back down.
OBI-WAN;I don't think so.
COUNT DOOKU;Ah, but if I must.
COUNT DOOKU;I have spent the last ten yearslearning to use the power of theDark Side. It gives me infinitelygreater power.
OBI-WAN;You will have to prove it.
COUNT DOOKU;Grand Master Kenobi, youdisappoint me. Yoda holds you insuch high esteem.
COUNT DOOKU;Surely you can do better?No, I'm surprised. Has Jediswordsmanship degenerated soquickly, or are you trying to makefun of me?Which is it?
COUNT DOOKU;come, come, Master Kenobi. Put meout of my misery.
COUNT DOOKU;That's brave of you, boy - butfoolish. I would have thoughtyou'd have learnt your lesson.
ANAKIN;I'm a slow learner.
COUNT DOOKU;You have unusual powers, youngPadawan. But not enought to saveyou this time.
ANAKIN;Don't bet on it!
OBI-WAN;Anakin!
COUNT DOOKU;Master Yoda. At last we shallknow who is the most powerful.
YODA;Count Dooku. No interest incontests, do I have.
YODA;The end for you, Count, this is.
COUNT DOOKU;Not yet
PADMÉ;Anakin!
CLONE CAPTAIN;Resistance is at an end, General.What are your orders ?
COUNT DOOKU;The Force is with us, my Master.
DARTH SIDIOUS;Welcome home, Lord Tyranus. You havedone well.
COUNT DOOKU;I bring you good news, my Lord.The war has begun.
DARTH SIDIOUS;Excellent. Everything is going as planned.
MACE WINDU;Where is your apprentice?
OBI-WAN;On his way back to Naboo. He isescorting Senator Amidala home.
OBI-WAN;I must admit without the clones,it would not have been a victory.
YODA;Victory? Victory, you say?
YODA;Not victory, a defeat, it was
